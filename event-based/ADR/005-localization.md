## Decision
We have chosen a phased localization strategy, prioritizing regions with high demand. This strategy includes:

## Consequences
### Advantages
- Fast market entry in priority regions.
- Efficient allocation of resources to areas with the highest demand.
- Ability to collect feedback and adjust features accordingly.

### Disadvantages
- Delayed service availability in less prioritized regions.
- Initial investment in a modular architecture to support future localization.
