# ADR 002: Polyglot Persistence Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The electronics recycling system has diverse data storage requirements:
- Need to store structured customer and transaction data
- Need to handle flexible device specifications and assessment rules
- Need to store large volumes of events
- Need both strong consistency for financial transactions and eventual consistency for analytics

## Decision
We will implement a polyglot persistence strategy using multiple specialized databases:
1. PostgreSQL for customer and transaction data
2. MongoDB for device catalog and assessment data
3. Apache Cassandra for event store
4. Redis for caching and session management

## Consequences

### Positive
- Each database is optimized for its specific use case
- Better performance for different types of queries
- Flexibility to choose consistency levels based on business requirements
- Improved scalability for different data types

### Negative
- Increased operational complexity
- Need to maintain expertise in multiple database systems
- More complex data consistency patterns
- Higher infrastructure costs

## Technical Details
- PostgreSQL
  - Used for: Customer data, financial transactions
  - Chosen for: ACID compliance, relational integrity
  - Configuration: Primary-replica setup with connection pooling

- MongoDB
  - Used for: Device catalog, assessment rules
  - Chosen for: Schema flexibility, document model
  - Configuration: Replica sets with sharding

- Cassandra
  - Used for: Event store, analytics data
  - Chosen for: High write throughput, horizontal scalability
  - Configuration: Multi-region cluster

- Redis
  - Used for: Caching, session management
  - Chosen for: High performance, in-memory operations
  - Configuration: Cluster mode with persistence
