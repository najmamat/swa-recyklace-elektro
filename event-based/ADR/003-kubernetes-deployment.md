# ADR 003: Kubernetes as Deployment Platform

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The electronics recycling system needs a robust deployment platform that can:
- Handle multiple microservices
- Scale services independently
- Provide high availability
- Support multiple environments
- Handle rolling updates
- Manage configuration and secrets
- Integrate with monitoring and logging systems

## Decision
We will use Kubernetes as our primary deployment platform, with services deployed as containers orchestrated by Kubernetes.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Consistent deployment across environments
- Automated scaling and self-healing
- Built-in service discovery and load balancing
- Container isolation and resource management
- Rich ecosystem of tools and integrations
- Declarative configuration management
- Support for blue-green deployments and canary releases

### Negative
- Complex to set up and maintain
- Requires specialized DevOps knowledge
- Higher initial infrastructure costs
- Steeper learning curve for development teams
- Potential over-engineering for simpler services

## Technical Details
- Deployment Strategy
  - Use of Helm charts for package management
  - Implementation of horizontal pod autoscaling
  - Resource limits and requests for all containers
  - Network policies for service isolation

- Infrastructure Components
  - Multiple worker nodes across availability zones
  - Separate namespaces for different environments
  - Service mesh for inter-service communication
  - External secrets management

- Monitoring and Logging
  - Prometheus for metrics collection
  - ELK stack for log aggregation
  - Grafana for visualization
  - Custom dashboards for business metrics

- Security Considerations
  - RBAC for access control
  - Network policies for pod-to-pod communication
  - Pod security policies
  - Regular security scanning of containers
