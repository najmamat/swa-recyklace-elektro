# ADR 001: Adoption of Event-Driven Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The electronics recycling system needs to handle complex workflows with multiple steps, integrate with various external services, and scale efficiently. The system needs to process device submissions, handle shipping logistics, manage assessments, and coordinate payments while maintaining consistency and reliability.

## Decision
We will implement an event-driven architecture using Apache Kafka as the central event bus, with event sourcing for critical business processes.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Loose coupling between services enables independent scaling and deployment
- Asynchronous processing improves system responsiveness
- Event sourcing provides complete audit trail of all transactions
- Easy to add new features by subscribing to existing events
- Natural fit for the business domain where each step in the recycling process can be modeled as events

### Negative
- Increased complexity in handling eventual consistency
- Need for careful event schema design and versioning
- Additional operational complexity in managing Kafka cluster
- Learning curve for developers not familiar with event-driven patterns

## Technical Details
- Apache Kafka will serve as the central event bus
- Events will be stored in Apache Cassandra for durability
- CQRS pattern will be implemented for complex queries
- Event schema versioning will use Apache Avro
