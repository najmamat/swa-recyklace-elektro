# Event-Based Architecture - Deployment Diagram

## Infrastructure Overview
The system is deployed across multiple cloud regions for high availability and disaster recovery.

## Deployment Components

### Frontend Layer
1. **Web Application**
   - Deployed on Kubernetes cluster
   - Auto-scaling based on load
   - Behind CDN for static content
   - Load balanced across multiple pods

2. **Kiosk Application**
   - Deployed on physical kiosks in shopping centers
   - Edge computing capabilities
   - Local caching for basic operations
   - Secure VPN connection to main infrastructure

### Service Layer
1. **Core Services**
   - Deployed on Kubernetes cluster
   - Horizontally scalable
   - Service mesh for inter-service communication
   - Health monitoring and auto-recovery

2. **Integration Services**
   - Deployed on separate Kubernetes namespace
   - Isolated network policies
   - Dedicated resources for external API calls
   - Circuit breakers for external service protection

### Event Infrastructure
1. **Apache Kafka Cluster**
   - Minimum 3 broker nodes
   - Zookeeper ensemble for coordination
   - Topic replication for fault tolerance
   - Message persistence with configurable retention

2. **Event Store (Apache Cassandra)**
   - Multi-node cluster
   - Cross-region replication
   - Configurable consistency levels
   - Regular backup strategy

### Databases
1. **MongoDB Clusters**
   - Replica sets for high availability
   - Automated backups
   - Sharding for large collections
   - Dedicated monitoring

2. **PostgreSQL**
   - Primary-replica configuration
   - Point-in-time recovery
   - Connection pooling
   - Regular maintenance windows

### Supporting Infrastructure
1. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Prometheus for metrics
   - ELK stack for log aggregation
   - Grafana for visualization
   - Alerting system

2. **Security**
   - WAF for web protection
   - Network segregation
   - API Gateway
   - Identity and Access Management

## Network Architecture
1. **Public Zone**
   - Load balancers
   - CDN
   - API Gateway

2. **Application Zone**
   - Application services
   - Integration services
   - Service mesh

3. **Data Zone**
   - Databases
   - Event store
   - Message brokers

## Scaling Strategy
1. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Auto-scaling groups for services
   - Database read replicas
   - Kafka partition scaling

2. **Geographic Distribution**
   - Multi-region deployment
   - Data replication across regions
   - CDN for static content

## Disaster Recovery
1. **Backup Strategy**
   - Regular database backups
   - Event log backups
   - Configuration backups

2. **Recovery Plan**
   - Defined RPO and RTO
   - Automated failover procedures
   - Regular DR testing
