# Event-Based Architecture - Advantages and Disadvantages

## Advantages

### 1. Scalability
- Services can scale independently based on event load (thousands to millions of users)
- Event replay capability for catalog cleanup and recovery
- Horizontal scaling through Kafka partitioning
- Independent scaling of Core, Integration, and Support processors

### 2. Flexibility
- Easy integration of new device types (5-10 monthly)
- Support for diverse assessment rules per device type
- New subscribers can consume existing events without system changes
- Simple addition of new sales channels or shipping providers

### 3. Reliability
- Circuit Breaker pattern for external system resilience
- Event persistence in Kafka ensures no data loss
- PostgreSQL replication for data durability
- Redis caching for improved response times

### 4. Loose Coupling
- Services communicate only through events via Kafka
- Clear separation between Core, Integration, and Support processors
- Independent deployment and updates of components
- Isolation of external system integrations

### 5. Real-time Processing
- Immediate processing of price offers
- Real-time integration with payment systems (Stripe)
- Asynchronous handling of long-running operations (device assessment)
- Real-time shipping status updates (PPL, ZÃ¡silkovna)

### 6. Business Alignment
- Events directly map business processes (receive -> assess -> offer -> payment)
- Easy implementation of yearly cleanup policy for inactive devices
- Support for different device assessment types
- Clear audit trail for price adjustments
- Natural integration with sales platforms (eBay, Aukro)

## Disadvantages

### 1. Complexity
- More complex than traditional request-response architectures
- Need for careful event schema design and versioning
- Complex flow of events across different processors
- Need to handle event ordering (ensuring events are processed in the correct sequence) and idempotency (ensuring duplicate events don't cause duplicate processing)

### 2. Learning Curve
- Team needs to understand event-driven patterns
- Knowledge required for Kafka operations
- Understanding of Circuit Breaker and other resilience patterns
- Expertise needed for monitoring and troubleshooting

### 3. Operational Overhead
- Management of Kafka cluster
- Monitoring of external integrations and circuit breakers
- PostgreSQL replication and Redis cache management
- Complex logging and tracing across event flows

### 4. Data Consistency
- Need to handle consistency during price offer changes
- Synchronization between e-shop and kiosk applications
- Consistency across different sales platforms
- Handling of concurrent device assessments
- Managing payment state across system

### 5. Cost
- Infrastructure costs for Kafka cluster
- High availability requirements for critical components
- Development time for implementing resilience patterns
- Monitoring and operational tools

### 6. Troubleshooting
- Complex error tracking across distributed events
- Need for comprehensive logging and tracing
- Difficulty in reproducing specific event sequences
- Debugging of circuit breaker behaviors

### 7. Security Considerations
- Secure payment processing through Stripe
- Protection of customer personal data
- Secure communication with external systems
- Audit trail for price offer changes
- Access control for different roles (Admin, Device Inspector, Sales Manager)

## Mitigation Strategies

### 1. For Complexity
- Well-defined event schemas with versioning
- Clear documentation of event flows
- Use of correlation IDs for tracking
- Standardized patterns for common operations

### 2. For Learning Curve
- Team training on event-driven architecture
- Documentation of common patterns and solutions
- Regular knowledge sharing sessions
- Gradual implementation of complex features

### 3. For Operational Overhead
- Automated Kafka cluster management
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Regular backup and recovery testing
- Clear operational procedures

### 4. For Data Consistency
- Idempotent event processing
- Clear event ordering strategies
- Compensation events for corrections
- Strong validation at event boundaries

### 5. For Cost
- Proper sizing of Kafka partitions
- Efficient use of caching
- Regular performance optimization
- Resource usage monitoring

### 6. For Security
- Regular security audits
- Encryption of sensitive data
- Strong authentication and authorization
- Comprehensive audit logging
