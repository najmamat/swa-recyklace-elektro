# ADR 001: Implementation of SOA with RESTful APIs and IBM App Connect ESB

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Our electronics recycling system requires a flexible and scalable architecture to handle:

- A large and potentially growing user base.
- Frequent changes in accepted device types.
- Complex business processes involving multiple services and external integrations.

We need an architecture that:

- Supports independent development and deployment of components.
- Facilitates integration with external partners.
- Enhances scalability and maintainability.

## Decision
We will implement a **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)** using **RESTful APIs**, centered around an **Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)** implemented with **IBM App Connect**.

1. **1.	Enterprise Service Bus**
   - IBM App Connect
   - Central message broker 
   - Messages persistence for replay and audit
   - Topic-based message routing

2. **Core Services**
   - Device Catalog Management
   - Assessment Processing
   - Offer Management

3. **Integration Services**
   - Shipping Integration (PPL, ZÃ¡silkovna)
   - Sales Integration (eBay, Aukro)
   - Payment Integration (Stripe)

4. **Support Services**
   - Analytics
   - Customer Support

5. **Frontend Services**
   - Web Application
   - Kiosk Application
   - Admin Application

6. **Cloud Logging and Monitoring Services**
   - AWS CloudWatch
   - AWS SNS

## Consequences

### Easier
- **Flexibility**: Easy to add or modify services as business needs evolve.
- **Reusability**: Services can be reused across different parts of the application.
- **Improved Integration**: Simplifies communication with external partners.

### More Difficult
- **Complexity**: Requires coordination between multiple services and proper management of the ESB.
- **Performance Overhead**: Inter-service communication can introduce latency.
- **Operational Overhead**: Increased need for monitoring and maintaining multiple services.
